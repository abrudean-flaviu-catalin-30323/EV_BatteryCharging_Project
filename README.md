This project was developed during my 2nd year at the Technical University of Cluj-Napoca, during a course held by Bosch about Autonomous Driving.
It simulates the charging of an EV battery over time, based on 3 parameters: battery state of charge [%], battery total capacity [Ah] and agreed chraging current between the EV and the station [A].
It displays the battery state of charge [%] and the remaining time until fully charged [m] based on the specific time sample given in Simulink
